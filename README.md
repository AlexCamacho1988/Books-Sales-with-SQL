# Books-Sales-with-SQL
Top selling authors, editorials and genres

Project description: Performed an analysis of the best-selling books, authors, publishers, and genres to provide recommendations to the marketing team on which books should be promoted to generate higher revenue.

Tools used: SQL, sqlalchemy, pandas

Challenge: the problem presented was to identify the top-selling authors and genres, with the goal of generating a value proposition for the marketing team regarding the launch of a new product or book. The main challenge was obtaining the database through SQLAlchemy and reading it using pandas.

Result: we found that the books by J.K. Rowling, Agatha Christie, and J.R.R. Tolkien are the best-selling ones, mainly in the fantasy and mystery genres. Therefore, the marketing team can focus its efforts on promoting books by these authors and within these genres. Additionally, if a new book is released, knowing that it belongs to these genres and is published by Penguin Books makes it a safe bet that the book will perform well in sales.
