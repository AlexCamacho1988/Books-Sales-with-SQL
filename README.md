# Books-Sales-with-SQL
Top selling authors, editorials and genres

Project Description:
An online bookstore wants to identify which books are most likely to be purchased in order to focus its advertising efforts on them.
The project objectives were:
- Set up an online connection to retrieve and download a database using SQL.
- Identify the best-selling books by author, publisher, and genre.
- Find total books published by date.
- Identify the relationship between book sales and user reviews
- Identify publishers that do not publish short books.
- Identify the authors with the highest ratings..

🔍 Key Findings
-There were more books published from the year 2000 to March 31, 2020 than from December 1, 1952 to the year 2000, even though the time range after 2000 is shorter.
-More recent books received higher ratings than older books.
-Penguin Books is the publisher that has released the largest number of books with more than 50 pages.
-J.K. Rowling was the highest rated author.
-There were no users who submitted more than 50 reviews.

🎯 Strategic Recommendations
-Promote books by authors such as J.K. Rowling, Agatha Christie, and J.R.R. Tolkien, as well as books in the fantasy and mystery genres.
-Promote recent books that are not reissues of long-published stories, since many people may have already read those older titles.
-Promote books from Penguin Books, as they are the publisher with the largest number of publications, making their titles more easily recognizable to readers.
